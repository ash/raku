# What is Raku

Raku is a programming language created by Larry Wall.

## Language definition

The language itself is defined by a massive test suite called [Roast](https://github.com/perl6/roast). You can create your own compiler, and if it passes the test suite, it can be called a Raku compiler. 

# Language implementation

As of today, the most complete and the only maintained compiler is [Rakudo](https://rakudo.org). It it bootstrapped using the Raku language itself. The most practical way of using Rakudo for our course is to install the [Rakudo Star](https://rakudo.org/files/star) distribution, which includes the compiler and a number of useful libraries and the package manager.
