# How to use this course

To follow this Raku course, you need to have the following:

* Some basic knowledge about programming
* A web browser to display the course text

You can either browse the couse online at [raku.tech](https://raku.tech), or clone a [repository from GitHub](https://github.com/ash/raku-course). The content is a set of Markdown files, so if you are browsing offline, use one of the tools to convert it to HTML (for example, use Microsoft Visual Code editor).

The cousre is not just a textbook explaining the Raku syntax. It contains a lot of excercises that you are supposed to make yourself. To do that, you need one of the following:

* Internet access so that you can code online at glot.io, and/or
* A Raku compiler installed on your computer.

Although a solution is given to every excercise, it would be better if you try to do it yourself first. For this purpose, the answer is always placed at a separate page. As Raku design follows the TIMTOWTDI _(There is more than one way to do it)_ motto, in most—if not any—cases, the problem can be solved differently. You are always encouraged to find better and more expressive ways.
